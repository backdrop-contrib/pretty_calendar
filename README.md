# Pretty Calendar

Produces a simple calendar block that displays content by date, as well as
calendar detail pages to display all content for a particular date. The date
can be selected from content creation time or from a custom date field.

## Installation

 - Install this module and its dependencies using the official 
  [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)

## Configuration and Usage

Settings can be found in the block configuration.

  - **Default calendar themes**:
    - Standard (flexible width)
    - Round (flexible width)
    - Gridy (fixed width - 182px)
    - Vista (fixed width - 192px)

  - **Event headings**: Choose a name for the events that will be displayed in
    the calendar when hovering over a date, such as "12 events." Enter a
    comma-separated words for numbers (e.g. `event, events`).

  - **Tooltip type**: Tooltips can display the amount of nodes to date or
    display links to nodes.
